# A-Frame Constructive Solid Geometry

An A-frame repository that allows the ability to operate with Constructive Solid Geometry across components.

It is based on Sebastian Baltes' work, but updated to newer versions of the A-frame.

For now there is no extensive documentation, but the functionalities and usage remain the same as the original project. So to understand more visit the repository.
